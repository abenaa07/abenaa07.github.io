Welcome!

My name is Boahemaa Adu-Oppong and I currently work at Pluton Biosciences as the Director of Data Science. My role evolves maintaining and building infrastructure to support all bioinformatic analyses. I apply my expertise in computational biology to help the team understand their data which takes advantage of our ability to do shotgun sequencing. My company is on the forefront of creating [sustainable microbial products](https://www.plutonbio.com/).

Not only do I love working on bioinformatic projects but I also am an avid Python coder with experience using version control and Amazon Web Services to engineer bioinformatic pipelines.

I received my Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) from the [Evolution, Ecology and Population Biology program at Washington Univresity in St. Louis](http://dbbs.wustl.edu/divprograms/eepb/Pages/default.aspx). I conducted my thesis in [Gautam Dantas' lab](http://www.dantaslab.org/) focusing on understanding how microbial communities are assembled and how their compositions can affect the phenotype of their host.

Besides being passionate about microbes, I love engaging with the St. Louis community by volunteering time conducting hands on science demonstrations with K-12 students. I have been involved with [The Young Scientist Program](http://ysp.wustl.edu) which is a graduate student ran organization devoted to increasing diversity in STEM. I am also a co-founder of a non-profit, Show Me The World Project, which aims to fundraise money for innercity students to travel abroad to learn about entrepreneurship alongside ecology.
