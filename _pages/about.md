Welcome!

I am a transformational AI/ML and data strategy leader with over a decade of experience building scalable data ecosystems, modern ML infrastructure, and enterprise governance frameworks across life sciences. My work spans leading GenAI-driven scientific innovation, architecting AWS based platforms that power compliant and reproducible R&D, and guiding organizations through digital transformation with clear, actionable strategy. I combine deep technical expertise in Python, cloud systems, and ML engineering with strong executive influence translating complex analytics into business value that accelerates discovery, strengthens regulatory readiness, and improves operational efficiency. As a scientist, engineer, and strategic operator, I am committed to advancing technology that unlocks new biological insights and expands global access to STEM opportunities.

I received my Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) from the [Evolution, Ecology and Population Biology program at Washington Univresity in St. Louis](http://dbbs.wustl.edu/divprograms/eepb/Pages/default.aspx). I conducted my thesis in [Gautam Dantas' lab](http://www.dantaslab.org/) focusing on understanding how microbial communities are assembled and how their compositions can affect the phenotype of their host.

Besides being passionate about microbes, I love engaging with the St. Louis community by volunteering time conducting hands on science demonstrations with K-12 students. I have been involved with [The Young Scientist Program](http://ysp.wustl.edu) which is a graduate student ran organization devoted to increasing diversity in STEM. I am also a co-founder of a non-profit, [Show Me The World Project](https://showmetheworldproject.org/), which aims to fundraise money for innercity students to travel abroad to learn about entrepreneurship alongside ecology.
